Callouts in Obsidian are visually styled blockquote elements designed to highlight important information using icons and colors. They're perfect for adding structure without breaking your note taking flow whether it's a quick tip, warning, or idea. While the built-in types like [!info], [!tip], and [!warning] are easy to use, they often fall short when your workflow demands more personalized structure. If you organize your notes by themes like morning routines, project status, or reflective journaling, you'll likely find the default options limiting. That's where customization and plugins come in. In this post, we'll explore the plugins that extend and enhance callouts in Obsidian, giving you full control over how they look, behave, and integrate into your personal system.
