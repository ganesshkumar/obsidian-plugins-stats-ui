> There are 3 new plugins and 89 plugin updates during the week 2025-09-14 to 2025-09-20.

This week may not have brought a many new plugins but one stood out and quickly stole the spotlight - Notebook Navigator. In just its first week, it has already gained serious traction, with users flocking to try its structured dual pane navigation and sleek, themeable interface. Alongside it, two smaller but handy additions landed, plus 89 updates that finetune existing favorites. It's clear that while the numbers were modest, the impact of Notebook Navigator made this week impossible to ignore.

## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Move Cursor On Startup](/plugins/move-cursor-on-startup)

Released on 2025-09-15 by [Jared Kelnhofer](https://github.com/Treadder)

The **Move Cursor On Startup** plugin automatically nudges the text cursor to the right and back to the left when the app launches. This small action addresses a known issue where DataView queries or expressions embedded in the first opened note sometimes fail to render properly on initial load. By forcing a tiny cursor movement, the plugin effectively refreshes the note's state so that dynamic content like DataView blocks display as intended without manual intervention.

### 2. [HOME key](/plugins/homekey-action)

Released on 2025-09-15 by [shichishima](https://github.com/shichishima)

The **HOME key** plugin adds a command that mimics the HOME key, giving users more control over cursor movement within notes. Unlike the default behaviour, this command moves the cursor to the start of meaningful text, respecting indents, list markers, task checkboxes, and even headings if the advanced mode is enabled. It allows Mac users to map Control+A to behave like Command+Left and can also be paired with Emacs-style key bindings on Windows.

### 3. [Notebook Navigator](/plugins/notebook-navigator)

Released on 2025-09-15 by [Johan Sanneblad](https://github.com/johansan)

The **Notebook Navigator** plugin replaces the default file explorer with a notes-style dual pane interface that prioritises fast navigation and visual organisation. It presents a hierarchical folder and tag tree alongside a configurable file list, supports keyboard first workflows, multi selection, drag and drop, and pinning to streamline file operations. Visual features include note previews, feature image thumbnails, date grouping and customizable appearances per folder or tag, plus extensive theming support and RTL layout handling. The plugin scales to very large vaults through virtualised rendering and IndexedDB caching, and exposes a public API for scripts and other plugins. Mobile and desktop interactions are considered equally, making it a full featured alternate navigator for users who prefer a more structured, themeable file browser.
