üéâ Happy New Year, Obsidian enthusiasts! After a quiet week with no new plugins, we‚Äôre kicking off 2025 with an exciting first post of the year. This week brings 9 fantastic new plugins and 80 updates‚Äîa perfect way to start the year by supercharging your productivity and creativity in Obsidian! üöÄ

## ‚≠ê New Plugins: We have 9 new plugins.

### 1. [Smart Link Alias](/plugins/smart-link-alias)

Released on 2024-12-30 by [Victor Perez-Cano](https://github.com/vpcano)

The **Smart Link Alias** plugin enhances how links to Obsidian notes are displayed. By allowing users to set custom aliases for note titles, it provides flexibility in how links appear across notes. Users can define different versions of a note's title, such as abbreviations or full titles, and switch between them easily. This is done by adding YAML frontmatter with properties like 'full-title' and 'short-title' and using specific link display formats like 'short', 'full', or 'long'. This plugin is ideal for users who prefer a more organized and customized link system within their Obsidian vault.

Released on 2024-12-30 by [Binaris](https://github.com/Binaris00)

The **Theme Controller** plugin provides flexible theme management for Obsidian, allowing users to dynamically switch between light and dark modes, as well as apply custom themes based on the active note‚Äôs path or specific tags. It offers a color switcher that allows toggling between themes easily, and the ability to set default themes when no specific settings are applied. The plugin enhances customization by enabling users to create a personalized Obsidian environment tailored to individual workflows or content types, with themes that automatically adjust based on context.

### 3. [Insert Multiple Attachments](/plugins/insert-multiple-attachments)

Released on 2024-12-30 by [mnaoumov](https://github.com/mnaoumov)

The **Insert Multiple Attachments** plugin enhances the default 'Insert Attachment' feature in Obsidian by enabling users to insert multiple attachments at once. This modification allows for a more efficient workflow, particularly when dealing with large numbers of files that need to be attached to a note. With this plugin, users can streamline their note-taking process by bypassing the need to insert attachments one by one, improving productivity and saving time when managing multiple files within their Obsidian vault.

### 4. [Smart Context](/plugins/smart-context)

Released on 2024-12-30 by [üå¥ Brian](https://github.com/brianpetro)

The **Smart Context** plugin enhances the ability to copy content from Obsidian for use with AI tools like ChatGPT. It allows users to copy entire folders or specific open files, including all linked content, to the clipboard. With advanced features such as excluding sections by heading (e.g., confidential content), it ensures only relevant material is shared. The plugin offers multiple commands, including options to copy content from visible files, all open files, or an entire folder. Notifications summarize the action taken, ensuring users have full control over the context provided to AI. This makes it easier to give AI tools a comprehensive understanding of a project or set of notes.

### 5. [Cursor Position on Title Enter](/plugins/cursor-position-on-title-enter)

Released on 2024-12-30 by [Por Chainarong Tangsurakit](https://github.com/chaintng)

The **Cursor Position on Title Enter** plugin for Obsidian allows users to customize the cursor position after pressing Enter on the note title. Users can choose from three options: returning to the last known cursor position, placing the cursor at the beginning of the note, or positioning it at the last line of the note. This simple but effective plugin enhances the user experience by providing greater control over where the cursor appears when creating or editing notes, making it easier to navigate and edit content.

### 6. [Project Tasks](/plugins/project-tasks)

Released on 2024-12-30 by [Paul Paterson](https://github.com/paulpaterson)

The **Project Tasks** plugin for Obsidian simplifies task management for projects by allowing users to create and manage task dependencies. With this plugin, tasks can be linked sequentially, ensuring that each task is completed before the next one begins. Users can customize task IDs, associate specific project tags, and create project views to track the status of tasks. The plugin also integrates with Dataview for displaying project tasks due now and supports managing task dependencies, including handling parallel or conditional tasks in the future. It is designed to work seamlessly with other task management plugins like Tasks and Dataview, offering enhanced functionality for organizing and tracking project progress.

### 7. [Send Note](/plugins/send-note)

Released on 2024-12-30 by [jvsteiner](https://github.com/jvsteiner)

The **Send Note** plugin enables users to easily share notes between Obsidian vaults via AWS S3. Notes are uploaded to a user-provided S3 bucket and shared using a URL, which is embedded in the note's YAML frontmatter. The plugin ensures security by encrypting the content of the notes, allowing only the sender and recipient to access the information. Users can also delete the notes directly from S3 via Obsidian. The plugin supports additional functionalities like setting up custom S3 configurations and integrating with other tools, such as the s3-image-uploader plugin, for seamless media file sharing. This plugin offers an efficient and secure way to collaborate and share notes across different users while maintaining privacy.

Released on 2024-12-30 by [LincZero](https://github.com/LincZero)

The **NodeFlow** plugin for Obsidian allows users to create and visualize node streams for software tools like ComfyUI, Unreal Engine, Houdini, and Blender. It enables the creation of flow diagrams using a lightweight syntax or JSON files, and integrates seamlessly with both Obsidian and VuePress blogs. Users can define tasks, actions, and relationships between nodes using code blocks or external workflow files. The plugin supports various node flow types and offers a flexible way to document complex workflows. It also provides interactive demos to help users understand the syntax and functionality, making it ideal for visualizing interconnected processes in a structured format.

Released on 2024-12-30 by [kalvn](https://github.com/kalvn)

The **Export to HTML** plugin for Obsidian allows you to easily export the content of your notes as HTML files or directly to your clipboard. This plugin retains the formatting and includes images in base64 format, ensuring the visual integrity of the note when pasted or saved. It supports exporting both as HTML files and clipboard content, making it convenient for sharing or using in other applications like emails or word processors. Though still in progress, the plugin functions well in most scenarios, with plans to improve image export in certain edge cases. Currently, the mobile version of Obsidian is not supported.
