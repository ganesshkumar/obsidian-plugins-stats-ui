üöÄ **Timeline view**

This week, I am thrilled to unveil a brand-new way to explore Obsidian plugins: the Timeline! Now, you can visually track changes over time, seeing the exact dates when plugins were added, updated, or removed.

You can check out the [Timeline View](/timeline) here.

## ‚≠ê New Plugins: We have 19 new plugins.

### 1. [New Filename](/plugins/new-file-name)

Released on 2025-01-17 by [Amin Sennour](https://github.com/TheLoneWanderer4)

The **New Filename** plugin allows users to customize the default filename for new files in Obsidian. Instead of the generic 'Undefined,' users can specify a preferred default name format to better suit their workflow and organizational preferences. Alternatively, leaving the setting blank enables the plugin to automatically generate a unique identifier (UUID) for each new file. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining consistency or ensuring unique file names without manual effort.

### 2. [External Rename Handler](/plugins/external-rename-handler)

Released on 2025-01-17 by [mnaoumov](https://github.com/mnaoumov)

The **External Rename Handler** plugin enhances Obsidian's ability to manage file renames performed outside the application. By default, external renames are processed as separate creation and deletion events in Obsidian, which can disrupt workflows and lead to inconsistencies. This plugin resolves the issue by detecting and treating such changes as a single rename event, ensuring a seamless integration with your file organization. To function, Obsidian must be running during external rename operations, making it a practical tool for users managing files across different environments.

Released on 2025-01-17 by [Hwenyi](https://github.com/Hwenyi)

The **Type Chinese Like English** plugin simplifies the process of typing Chinese and Mathjax/LaTeX formulas in Obsidian without frequently switching input methods. Users can input pinyin directly in English mode and have it converted into Chinese characters or mathematical expressions seamlessly. This is especially useful for those using full-pinyin input methods or needing quick, accurate math notation without mastering LaTeX syntax. The plugin supports mixed English and pinyin input for enhanced versatility and allows customization of APIs and model selection to improve conversion accuracy.
