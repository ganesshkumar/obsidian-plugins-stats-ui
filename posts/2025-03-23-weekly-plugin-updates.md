## ⭐ New Plugins: We have 15 new plugins.

### 1. [File Title Updater](/plugins/file-title-updater)

Released on 2025-03-18 by [wenlzhang](https://github.com/wenlzhang)

The **File Title Updater** plugin streamlines title management across different parts of an Obsidian note by keeping the filename, frontmatter title, and first-level heading in sync. It offers flexible commands that let users choose a preferred source of truth—whether that's the file name, metadata, or heading—and updates the other two accordingly. With built-in smart detection, the plugin avoids redundant operations if the titles are already aligned. It also handles formatting niceties, such as inserting appropriate spacing and cleaning up illegal characters in file names.

Users can annotate specific timestamps with comments, making it easy to jump to important sections during review. Playback controls such as speed, volume, looping, and autoplay offer a customizable listening experience, while sticky controls ensure accessibility during scrolling.

When you begin a list item with a specific marker, the plugin automatically inserts the current time, streamlining the process of logging events or tasks chronologically. It also maintains timestamp flow by auto-inserting the current time when continuing a timestamped list, helping users effortlessly track sequences. This is especially useful for meetings, research, time tracking, and daily logs where precise timing adds context.

This is especially useful for those who operate across different workflows, projects, or contexts that each benefit from a dedicated daily log. With configurable options, the plugin supports multiple sets of daily notes that can be directed to separate folders, each with its own naming conventions and structure. This provides added flexibility for users who want to keep personal, work, or topic-specific notes organized without cluttering a single daily note.

The **Tagvis** plugin offers a visual approach to navigating and analyzing tags within your Obsidian vault. Using a sunburst chart, it provides an intuitive graphical representation of tag hierarchies and their relationships across files.
