The plugin ensures that if there are conflicting edits on the remote note, it will alert you rather than risk overwriting your work. You can also pull changes from HackMD back into your Obsidian notes, ensuring you always have the latest content. Additional features include options to force push or pull, copy the remote URL, and delete the remote note entirely. This plugin streamlines your workflow for users who frequently switch between Obsidian and HackMD, allowing for smoother collaboration and version management.
