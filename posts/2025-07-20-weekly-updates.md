> There are 4 new plugins and 1 new theme. 84 plugins got updated and 1 plugin got removed during the week 2025-07-13 to 2025-07-19.

This week's plugin updates are on the quieter side but still bring a few interesting additions. Four new plugins have been released, including tools for object-oriented workflows, nutrition tracking, and AI-powered note enrichment. Unreal Engine users also get a plugin for visualising blueprints right in their vault. Along with 84 plugin updates and a subtle new theme, it's a steady week of improvements for those keeping their setups lean and efficient.


## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Object Oriented Thinking](/plugins/object-oriented-thinking)

Released on 2025-07-20 by [Tiago Jacinto](https://github.com/TiagoJacinto)

The **Object Oriented Thinking** plugin introduces inheritance like behaviour to notes by allowing one note to extend another using frontmatter properties. It provides utility methods for querying and determining hierarchical relationships between notes, enabling advanced workflows where child notes can inherit attributes from parent notes. Developers can leverage these methods in Dataview queries or custom scripts to build dynamic, object-oriented structures within their vault. This makes it particularly useful for organising complex systems like task hierarchies, documentation, or knowledge bases.

### 2. [Food Tracker](/plugins/food-tracker)

Released on 2025-07-20 by [Forketyfork](https://github.com/forketyfork)

The **Food Tracker** plugin helps you monitor food intake by tracking calories, macronutrients, and other nutritional details directly within notes. It supports detailed nutrient databases, integration with OpenFoodFacts for quick data imports, and flexible food entry methods including both database-driven and inline tracking. The plugin calculates real-time nutrition totals with visual progress bars and emoji indicators, helping users stay aligned with daily goals. Customisable settings allow tailored tags, storage locations, and goal configurations, making it highly adaptable for personal nutrition tracking workflows.

### 3. [deepseek-ai-assistant](/plugins/deepseek-ai-assistant)

Released on 2025-07-17 by [algernon](https://github.com/mali-i)

The **Deepseek AI Assistant** plugin integrates Deepseek AI directly into notes, enabling users to ask questions and insert responses seamlessly. It supports a problem-driven learning approach by letting you enrich your notes with AI-generated answers. Additionally, the plugin tracks and visualises all questions asked over the past three months, helping users reflect on their curiosity trends and compare past and present interests.

### 4. [Blueprint Renderer](/plugins/blueprint-renderer)

Released on 2025-07-15 by [goderyu](https://github.com/goderyu)

The **Blueprint Renderer** plugin enables users to render Unreal Engine Blueprint code as interactive visual diagrams directly within their notes. By leveraging the BlueprintUE Self-Hosted Edition's rendering engine, it ensures full compatibility with all node types and connections without requiring any complex setup. The plugin dynamically loads original rendering scripts and styles, maintaining a clean integration with minimal impact on Obsidian's styling. Its architecture prioritises simplicity, making it easier to maintain and less prone to conflicts.
