## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Note Sync](/plugins/note-sync)

Released on 2025-06-03 by [ZigHolding](https://github.com/zigholding)

The **Note Sync** plugin enables users to mirror notes, folders, and embedded attachments from one vault to another with preserved file structure and optional overwrite rules. It supports exporting entire plugins, including optional `data.json` files, and allows any note to be exported as a customized `readMe` with attachment handling and metadata control. The plugin includes a Git integration feature to download files or folders from specified repositories and branches, helping users quickly populate vaults with starter content. Advanced settings let users define vault targets, enable strict sync modes (which can delete unmatched files), and script sync operations via provided JavaScript functions. Ideal for multi-vault workflows, plugin developers, and those managing structured documentation across locations.

### 2. [Book Smith](/plugins/book-smith)

Released on 2025-06-03 by [Yeban](https://github.com/Yeban8090)

The **Book Smith** plugin streamlines long-form writing projects by offering a complete book project management system with chapter organization, progress tracking, and customizable templates. Writers can build multiple books, assign cover images, and manage metadata with ease. Chapters are organized in a drag-and-drop tree structure, with support for tracking their status. Real-time word count, daily writing stats, and visual goal tracking help maintain consistency and momentum. A built-in focus mode leverages the Pomodoro technique to encourage deep work, with custom work and break durations. The plugin also includes a citation management system for generating references, inserting numbered quotes, and searching citations. With export options and mobile-friendly support, it caters to authors, academics, and anyone working on structured writing projects.

### 3. [Notemd](/plugins/notemd)

Released on 2025-06-03 by [Jacob](https://github.com/Jacobinwwey)

The **Notemd** plugin transforms your note-taking experience by integrating AI-powered processing and knowledge graph automation. It connects to both cloud and local LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and LMStudio to intelligently chunk and process documents, insert context-aware wiki-links, and auto-generate concept notes. It includes features like web search summarization using Tavily or DuckDuckGo, duplicate detection and cleanup, and batch Mermaid/LaTeX syntax correction. Notes can be processed in bulk, with customizable file naming and storage paths. The plugin also supports retry logic for failed API calls, stable connection testing, and detailed configuration of provider settings. It‚Äôs ideal for users building a personal knowledge base or conducting research-driven writing with structured link graphs.

### 4. [YAML Table](/plugins/yaml-table)

Released on 2025-06-03 by [dainakai](https://github.com/dainakai)

The **YAML Table** plugin lets users convert YAML code blocks into clean, responsive HTML tables directly within notes. By using a custom language identifier (default: `yaml-table`), it enables real-time rendering of YAML content such as key-value pairs, lists, and nested structures. This makes data-heavy notes far easier to read and visually parse. Captions can also be added inline, and the rendered tables support horizontal scrolling for overflow content. The plugin works seamlessly in Reading View and Live Preview, and users can click the rendered table to edit the underlying YAML. It's a handy solution for turning structured data into legible, styled tables without leaving the note environment.

### 5. [Daily Task Auto Generator](/plugins/daily-task-auto-generator)

Released on 2025-06-03 by [maigamo](https://github.com/maigamo)

The **Daily Task Auto Generator** plugin automates the creation of daily task notes using customizable templates, streamlining your personal task management workflow. It can generate entries on a daily or workday-only schedule and supports variable placeholders such as date, time, weekday, and progress indicators for year and month. Users can configure folder structures to neatly organize generated notes by year and month. The plugin also tracks task completion statistics from the previous day and appends them to the note, offering a feedback loop to help improve consistency.

### 6. [Create Note with Date in This Directory](/plugins/create-note-with-date)

Released on 2025-05-30 by [Sangrak Choi](https://github.com/kargnas)

The **Create Note with Date** plugin simplifies the process of generating a new note with today‚Äôs date as the filename, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. It places the file directly in the currently open directory and opens it automatically, making it ideal for daily journaling. The command is easily accessible via the palette. It also supports multiple languages including Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese. Core plugin Daily Notes and community plugins like Calendar, Periodic Notes etc. do the same but if you are looking for language support you can use this instead.
