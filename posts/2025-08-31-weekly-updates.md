> There are 1 new plugins, 2 new themes and 122 plugin updates during the week 2025-08-24 to 2025-08-30.

It's the final stretch of august and we've got something sharp to highlight. **AI Image OCR** lands as the only new release this week, and it's already turning heads with its powerful ability to pull clean, markdown-ready text from images using openai, gemini or even local models. Meanwhile, two striking new themes got released as well.

What's especially exciting is the growing momentum behind "bases" Obsidian's new core plugin for creating database like views of your notes. Plugin authors and theme builders are racing to enable bases support, with experiments already showing promise, like property colors appearing seamlessly in bases views.


## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [AI Image OCR](/plugins/ai-image-ocr)

Released on 2025-08-30 by [Rootiest](https://github.com/rootiest)

The **AI Image OCR** plugin enables text extraction from images using modern AI-powered OCR models. It supports both cloud-based providers like OpenAI's GPT-4 family and Google's Gemini series, as well as local models through Ollama or LM Studio. Users can configure where the extracted text should appear-replacing the image embed, inserting at the cursor, or appending to another note. The plugin works with common formats such as PNG and JPG, and offers markdown-formatted output with optional headers, footers, and file naming templates using placeholders. It also allows integration with custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. For users who prefer not to rely on cloud services, local model support ensures offline capability. This makes the plugin suitable for handling everything from simple printed text to complex handwriting, with flexible output customization to fit different note-taking workflows.
