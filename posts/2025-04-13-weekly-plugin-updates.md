Clusters and their member notes are rendered as interconnected nodes that can be pinned, filtered, and reorganized with ease. Users can dynamically adjust link strength thresholds, manage cluster composition, and highlight relational paths through multi-select and box selection tools. The visualization supports zooming, hovering, and direct editing of cluster memberships, making it easier to understand the structure of your vault at a glance.
