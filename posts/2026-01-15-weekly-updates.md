> There are 3 new plugins and 65 plugin updates during the week 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-10.

We have three new powerful plugins this week. Conditional Properties brings automation to your frontmatter with intelligent IF/THEN rules that handle tagging, property updates, and bulk operations without you lifting a finger. Auto Keyword Linker builds your knowledge graph automatically by converting terms into wiki links across your entire vault, while AI suggestions surface patterns you never noticed. Rounding out the trio is Disable Tabs for those who crave singular focus—one note, zero distractions. Plus 65 plugin updates landed last week with major releases from Excalidraw, Notebook Navigator, and TaskNotes.
