The Obsidian plugin ecosystem has seen another vibrant week of updates and additions, bringing fresh capabilities to enhance your note-taking experience. With 12 new plugins introduced and 83 plugin updates rolled out, there's a wealth of features to explore. These plugins cater to diverse needs, from streamlined file management to advanced publishing tools. As we delve into these innovations, discover how they can elevate your productivity and creativity within Obsidian.

## Base Toolbox

Obsidian released [bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) - a core plugin that lets you turn any set of notes into a powerful database - in the early access version 1.9.0+. Here is a tool, [Bases Toolbox](https://bases-toolbox.vercel.app/#dataview-converter) by [Quorafind](https://github.com/Quorafind), to convert your dataview (TABLE) queries into bases. I have used this on a few of my dataview tables and it worked like a charm!

## ‚≠ê New Plugins: We have 12 new plugins.

### 1. [Viewer ftags](/plugins/viewer-ftags)

Released on 2025-05-20 by [d7sd6u](https://github.com/d7sd6u)

The **Viewer Ftags Chips** plugin enhances your workspace by visually representing file tag relationships using chip-style UI elements. It displays chips above each file view for all ftags (folder-based tags), with immediate parent tags highlighted prominently and distant ancestors rendered more transparently. Users can quickly remove tags or move files to an inbox folder if left untagged. When used with Crosslink Advanced, an additional button allows for easy tag assignment. It also shows child file chips below the main ones, with support for tooltips, right-click context menus, and overflow handling for large child sets. This visual tagging interface helps you manage complex note hierarchies more intuitively.
