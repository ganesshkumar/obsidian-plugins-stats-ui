## ⭐ New Plugins

### 1. [Custom Syntax Highlights](/plugins/custom-syntax-highlights)

Released on 2025-11-21 by [Outsiders17711](https://github.com/Outsiders17711)

The **Custom Syntax Highlights** plugin enables syntax highlighting for files with non-standard extensions by mapping them to a chosen language. Users can configure extension-to-language mappings through settings, allowing files like `.bib`, `.tex`, or `.py` to be rendered as readable, colour-coded code blocks in reading view. The plugin ensures these files open directly in reading mode, offering a clean, formatted display ideal for reviewing source files without editing. It also includes an option to disable highlighting for certain extensions by mapping them to markdown. Markdown files themselves are excluded since they are already handled natively. The plugin draws inspiration from earlier work on custom file extensions but expands its functionality significantly.

### 2. [LaTeX autocomplete](/plugins/latex-autocomplete)

Released on 2025-11-21 by [Yanis Gerst](https://github.com/Yanis-Gerst)

The **LaTeX Auto-Completion Plugin** provides a basic autocomplete feature for LaTeX commands while editing notes. When users type a backslash followed by a partial command, the plugin offers relevant suggestions, streamlining the process of writing LaTeX within markdown files. Though currently limited to simple completions, it lays the groundwork for more sophisticated input assistance. Planned enhancements include intelligent shortcuts that expand shorthand expressions like '\a/b' into full LaTeX commands such as '\frac{a}{b}', potentially improving speed and accuracy for users writing complex math expressions.

### 3. [Life in Weeks Calendar](/plugins/life-in-weeks-calendar)

Released on 2025-11-19 by [Jeff Szuc](https://github.com/szuc)

The **Life in Weeks Calendar** plugin presents your lifespan as a grid of weeks, turning an abstract idea into something you can see at a glance. It highlights past, current and future weeks, and becomes more meaningful when paired with weekly notes, where the calendar marks the weeks that already have entries. The plugin supports two layouts: a simpler view that compresses each year into fifty-week rows for flexibility, and a decade-based view that shows the true week counts for each year.

### 4. [AI Nutrition Tracker](/plugins/ai-nutrition-tracker)

Released on 2025-11-19 by [rnaidenov](https://github.com/rnaidenov)

The **AI Nutrition Tracker** plugin brings AI-driven food analysis into your notes by turning meal descriptions or photos into structured nutrition logs. It works with text or images, interpreting portions, cooking styles and complex dishes to estimate calories, protein, carbs and fat. Saved meals help with routine tracking, and the generated entries can use detailed cards or simpler layouts depending on how you prefer to review your intake. The plugin supports multiple models through OpenRouter, letting you pick from options like Claude, GPT or Gemini for the analysis workflow.

### 5. [List to table converter](/plugins/list-table-converter)

Released on 2025-11-18 by [paddomanno](https://github.com/paddomanno)

The **List to table converter** plugin offers a quick way to transform plain lists into structured tables. It reads each line in a text list whether it is a bullet point, numbered entry or a checkbox and turns it into its own table row.

### 6. [My Typewriter Line](/plugins/my-typewriter-line)

Released on 2025-11-18 by [dmo-code](https://github.com/dmo-code)

The **My Typewriter Line** plugin adds a simple but effective control that lets you decide where the active line should sit vertically while writing. It introduces a single slider that adjusts top scroll padding, and the bottom value updates automatically so the total always stays balanced. This creates a steady typewriter-style focus zone, especially helpful when drafting long notes or working in a minimal layout. The plugin avoids extra clutter, keeping its behaviour predictable and easy to tune.
