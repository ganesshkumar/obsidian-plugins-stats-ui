> There are 2 new plugins, 6 new themes and 128 plugin updates during the week 2025-09-20 to 2025-10-04.

It's been a slower couple of weeks for new releases, but something big is brewing beneath the surface. The new **Bases API** is quietly reshaping how plugins interact with data - and Obsidian's own **Maps** plugin gives us the first stunning preview of that power. On the visual side, six fresh themes have arrived - from neon brilliance to sleek minimalism - giving your vault a complete makeover. With 128 updates rounding it off, the last two week feels less like a lull and more like Obsidian catching its breath before the next big leap.

## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Maps](/plugins/maps)

Released on 2025-10-02 by [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd)

The **Map view for Obsidian Bases** plugin adds a geographical perspective to your notes by turning linked data in Bases into an interactive map. It allows you to display markers that update dynamically based on filters, making it easy to visualise note collections in spatial context. Markers can be styled with custom icons from the Lucide library and coloured using RGB, HEX, or CSS variables, offering strong visual cues for different categories. You can also load custom background tiles for a personalised map experience and define default zoom levels to control navigation. Coordinates can be stored as text, lists, or split into latitude and longitude properties, providing flexibility in data entry.

### 2. [XMind Linker](/plugins/xmind-linker)

Released on 2025-09-25 by [Leafney](https://github.com/leafney)

The **XMind Linker** plugin makes it possible to view and embed XMind mind maps directly inside your notes. It integrates closely with the XMind desktop software, allowing one-click editing and smooth transitions between external editing and in-app viewing. Users can insert `.xmind` files with simple markdown syntax, preview them interactively, and even generate thumbnail images automatically for quick identification. The plugin offers hover-based action menus, caching for faster previews, and multilingual interface support in English and Simplified Chinese. By combining file parsing, system integration, and embedded viewing, it creates a practical workflow for those who rely on structured mind maps while keeping their notes visually rich and interactive.
