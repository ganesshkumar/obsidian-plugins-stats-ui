> There are 7 new plugins and 96 plugin updates during the week 2025-10-26 to 2025-11-01.

As we step into November, the Obsidian community has been buzzing with fresh energy. This week brought 7 brand-new plugins and a whopping 96 updates, each adding its own spark to productivity, creativity, and automation. From Steward's LLM-powered command workflows to Cliplet's private snippet manager and MrDoc's seamless sync bridge, there's something here for every kind of note-taker. Mobile users get a treat too, with a slick new sidebar experience, while Card Viewer and GH Links Shortener make your notes neater and visually richer. Let's dive into the highlights of this week's plugin lineup.

## ⭐ New Plugins

### 1. [GH Links Shortener](/plugins/gh-links-shortener)

Released on 2025-11-02 by [David Barnett](https://github.com/dbarnett)

The **GH Links Shortener** plugin automatically formats pasted GitHub URLs into clean, readable reference links. When you paste a link to a repository, issue, or pull request, it detects the pattern and replaces the full URL with a concise identifier like `user/repo#issue-number`, keeping notes tidy and easier to scan. It works silently in the background without altering other pasted text or non-GitHub links.

### 2. [MrDoc](/plugins/mrdoc)

Released on 2025-10-30 by [zmister](https://github.com/zmister2016)

The **MrDoc Sync** plugin connects your local vault with the self-hosted MrDoc knowledge base, enabling seamless two-way synchronization between local markdown files and online documents. It keeps vaults and MrDoc collections in sync, automatically managing file creation, renaming, modification, and deletion while maintaining accurate mapping relationships. Users can manually or automatically push updates to MrDoc, pull remote changes, or enable real-time synchronization for instant updates. The plugin also handles image uploads, automatically transferring pasted or dragged images to MrDoc and updating the file links.

### 3. [Card Viewer](/plugins/card-viewer)

Released on 2025-10-30 by [vsme](https://github.com/vsme)

The **Card Viewer** plugin creates elegant, information-rich card layouts for movies, TV shows, books, and music directly within your notes. Each card displays structured metadata like title, release date, rating, genre, and cover image in a clean visual format. It supports image previews in grid view with lightbox functionality and can also render HTML code blocks for interactive content. Ratings, durations, and layouts are automatically formatted for consistency, while book cards can include publisher, author, and ISBN details.

### 4. [Mobile Sidebar Notes](/plugins/mobile-sidebar-notes)

Released on 2025-10-30 by [Chris Kephart](https://github.com/ckep1)

The **Mobile Sidebar Notes** plugin lets you open notes or create new tabs directly within the sidebar on mobile, bringing desktop-style multitasking to smaller screens. It supports all editor types, including canvas, while keeping full editing functionality intact. You can configure commands to open specific notes instantly, use autocomplete for note paths, and prevent duplicate tabs for the same note. Tabs remain pinned or persistent between sessions, allowing smoother navigation for reading and editing multiple notes at once.

### 5. [Cliplet](/plugins/cliplet)

Released on 2025-10-29 by [namikaze-40p](https://github.com/namikaze-40p)

The **Cliplet** plugin acts as a private clipboard and snippet manager within your vault, independent of the system clipboard. It lets you capture, store, and reuse text or code snippets effortlessly without overwriting your OS clipboard. You can keep a searchable history of snippets and access them across devices using an optional `data.json` file stored in your vault, or keep them isolated per device through IndexedDB. Each cliplet is encrypted at rest, ensuring privacy even in synced environments.

### 6. [Sync-safe file names](/plugins/sync-safe-file-names)

Released on 2025-10-29 by [j-maas](https://github.com/j-maas)

The **Sync-safe File Names** plugin automatically ensures that your note filenames remain compatible across devices by removing unsupported or special characters. It replaces unsafe symbols like question marks or slashes with hyphens, preventing sync failures that often occur on mobile or cloud storage. The plugin monitors new and renamed files in real time, renaming them instantly without overwriting existing content. You can also run a report to detect unsafe filenames and batch-fix them using built-in commands.

### 7. [Steward](/plugins/steward)

Released on 2025-10-29 by [Dang Nguyen](https://github.com/googlicius)

The **Steward** plugin adds an LLM-driven command layer over your vault, combining a fast TF-IDF search (with typo tolerance) and an adaptive chat UI that works in editor or reading view. Use slash commands to search, create, update, move, copy, or delete notes, then chain them into powerful user-defined workflows written in simple YAML. It supports multiple model providers-OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, and local Ollama-with automatic fallbacks and intent caching via embeddings to cut token usage. Triggers let commands run on file events for hands-free automation.
