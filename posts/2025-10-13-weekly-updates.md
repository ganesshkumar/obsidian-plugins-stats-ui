> There are 3 new plugins and 41 plugin updates during the week 2025-10-04 to 2025-10-11.

A light week, but full of impact. Only three new plugins dropped, yet each brings something genuinely useful to the table. Google Calendar Importer pulls your schedule straight into your daily notes, Tasks Map turns your to-dos into a living graph, and Radial Timeline reimagines storytelling through stunning circular visuals. Add to that forty-one plugin updates fine-tuning performance and features across the board. It's the kind of week where quality quietly outshines quantity - perfect for giving your Obsidian setup a clean, focused boost.

## ⭐ New Plugins

### 1. [Google Calendar Importer](/plugins/google-calendar-importer)

Released on 2025-10-11 by [Fan Li](https://github.com/lexafaxine)

The **Google Calendar Importer** plugin syncs your Google Calendar events directly into your notes, allowing automatic or manual insertion of daily schedules. It can inject events into your daily note when opened or import them anywhere using a command. You can also select specific dates, and live calendar blocks render your events dynamically within markdown. It uses secure OAuth 2.0 authentication to connect with Google Calendar and respects user privacy by fetching data on demand without storing it permanently.

### 2. [Tasks Map](/plugins/tasks-map)

Released on 2025-10-11 by [NicoKNL](https://github.com/NicoKNL)

The **Tasks Map** plugin visualizes all your tasks as an interactive graph, showing how they relate to one another through emoji and link syntax from the Tasks plugin. Each task appears as a draggable node with details like summary, tags, priority emoji, and completion status, while edges represent task dependencies or references. You can filter by tags, mark tasks as complete, and open linked files directly from the graph. The layout automatically organizes nodes using dagre for clarity, and relationships can be deleted by removing the connecting hashes. Built with a modern React Flow interface, it provides a visual and intuitive way to manage interconnected tasks inside your vault.

### 3. [Radial timeline](/plugins/radial-timeline)

Released on 2025-10-10 by [Eric Rhys Taylor](https://github.com/EricRhysTaylor)

The **Radial Timeline** plugin visualises a manuscript as a circular timeline, arranging scenes by act, subplot, and order so you can scan the whole story at once. It supports any plot system via YAML, shows rich details on hover (title, date, synopsis, subplot, character, overdue and revision lines), and opens the scene or plot note on click. Status colours make progress obvious, and a completion date is estimated from remaining work and recent pace. Switch between an all-scenes view and a main-plot mode that emphasises publishing stages. Zero-draft mode helps avoid premature editing by capturing pending edits in a dialog instead of opening the note. A fast search overlays results, subplot rings are labeled, and the layout rotates counter-clockwise to align act 2 beneath act 1 for readability.
