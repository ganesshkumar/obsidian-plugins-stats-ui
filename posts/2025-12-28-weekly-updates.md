> There are 6 new plugins and 84 plugin updates during the week 2025-12-21 to 2025-12-27.

Happy New Year - almost. With the year wrapping up, this week's Obsidian community brings in 6 new plugins and 84 plugin updates. New releases cover time tracking directly inside tags, restoring the cursor to your last edit and even vertical writing for long form Japanese text. Research, linguistics, and media notes also get attention through Zotero integration, phonetic notation support and AI-powered audio transcription. It's a practical and well-rounded set of changes to close out the year and step into the New Year better prepared.
