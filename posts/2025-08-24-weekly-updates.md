> There are 3 new plugins, 2 new themes and 179 plugin updates during the week 2025-08-10 to 2025-08-24.

Since there was only a single new plugin last week, I held off on posting and rolled it into this update instead. This round covers the past two weeks, and it turned out to be a busy one. We saw three new releases - Kindle Vocab, Linear, and packUp4AI - each serving very different purposes. On top of that, 2 new themes arrived and a massive 179 plugin updates shipped, with highlights from well-known projects like Tasks and Extended Graph. Plenty has happened, so let's jump right in.

## Beta Plugins and Themes

And while the plugin ecosystem kept us busy, there's something new on our end too. We've introduced a **Beta section on Obsidian Stats** that shines a light on plugins and themes still in open GitHub pull requests. It helps you spot experimental ideas early, search by name, description, or author, and browse them separately as plugins or themes. This space is aimed at early adopters who enjoy testing, sharing feedback, and shaping projects before they officially make it to the community list. Entries may change as PRs evolve, but many can already be installed via BRAT, making it easier to try them out. You can explore all beta entries [here](https://www.obsidianstats.com/beta), focus on [plugins](https://www.obsidianstats.com/beta/plugins), or check out [themes](https://www.obsidianstats.com/beta/themes).

**Note:** Beta plugins & themes are used at your own risk. These are plugins & themes with open PRs waiting to be merged into the community plugin/theme lists. Beta entries are not yet officially released or reviewed by Obsidian. Usually installed via BRAT (Beta Review and Testing) community plugin. Functionality, security, and stability are not guaranteed.

## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Kindle Vocab](/plugins/kindle-vocab)

Released on 2025-08-22 by [Truong Gia Bao](https://github.com/bao-tg)

The **Kindle Vocab** plugin helps you turn vocabulary lookups from your Kindle device into structured, interactive notes. By importing the `vocab.db` file from your Kindle, it generates a vocabulary builder in Markdown format that you can review and update inside your workspace. The plugin supports integration with public dictionary CSV files, such as Webster's or customized Wiktionary exports, so that each word can include definitions and related details. Words can be marked as learned or unlearned using checkboxes, and progress is tracked with statistics like percentage learned. You can also sort entries by timestamp or focus on unlearned words first, making study sessions more effective. A sync function keeps your vocabulary file updated, and all changes are reflected interactively in preview mode.

### 2. [Linear](/plugins/linear)

Released on 2025-08-22 by [Casey Becking](https://github.com/caseybecking)

The **Linear** plugin integrates your Linear workspace with your notes, letting you embed and filter issues directly inside them. You can configure code blocks with options to limit the number of issues, filter by team, status, or assignee, and even sort results by due date. Visual cues like color-coded badges and emoji indicators highlight statuses and deadlines, making it easier to track what needs attention. The plugin also supports toggling descriptions, combining multiple filters for precise views, and showing due date indicators for today, tomorrow, upcoming, or overdue tasks. Status colors match your Linear workflow states for consistency. A debug mode is available to log detailed activity, which is useful for troubleshooting.

### 3. [packUp4AI](/plugins/packup4ai)

Released on 2025-08-17 by [Jeffry](https://github.com/shuxueshuxue)

The **packUp4AI** plugin helps you prepare meaningful context bundles from your notes for use with AI chatbots or large language models. Starting from the active note, it gathers linked notes up to a configurable depth and optionally includes backlinks. The collected notes are displayed in an interactive D3-based graph, where node size reflects word count, making relationships easy to understand. Along with visualization, it provides statistics like total and average word counts to gauge the size of the bundle. You can refine the process with settings such as excluded files, output filenames, and default collection parameters.
