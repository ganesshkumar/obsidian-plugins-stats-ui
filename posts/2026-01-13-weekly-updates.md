> There are 6 new plugins, 4 new themes and 53 plugin updates during the week 2025-12-28 to 2026-01-03.

This week brings six fresh plugins that tackle everything from automatic templating to pomodoro timers, plus a beta release for custom views. The standout additions include Default Template for effortless note creation, Open in Terminal for developers who live in the command line and Asciinema Player for embedding terminal recordings right into your notes. We also got 53 plugin updates and four new themes that range from bold brutalist aesthetics to serene minimalism.
