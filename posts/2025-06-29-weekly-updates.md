## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Gyazo Viewer](/plugins/gyazo)

Released on 2025-06-25 by [Helpfeel Inc.](https://github.com/nota)

The **Gyazo Viewer** plugin brings seamless integration between your notes and Gyazo, a popular image capture and sharing service. It offers a sidebar gallery where you can browse your most recent Gyazo captures, with support for drag-and-drop embedding directly into your notes. Hover-based markdown copying, context menu actions like opening in browser or copying URLs, and a detailed view with metadata make image handling quick and efficient. The plugin supports both free and Pro Gyazo accounts

### 2. [Quartz Syncer](/plugins/quartz-syncer)

Released on 2025-06-25 by [Emile Bangma](https://github.com/saberzero1)

The **Quartz Syncer** plugin bridges your notes with Quartz, a static-site generator that turns markdown files into personal websites. It lets you publish selected notes directly from your vault to your Quartz repository on GitHub using the GitHub REST API. The plugin only pushes content from a user-defined folder, ensuring your main vault remains untouched. It's a one-way sync - from vault to Quartz - designed with clarity and control. Users can define exactly which notes go live, and changes are pushed after comparing against the existing Quartz repo content. This tool is ideal for people maintaining digital gardens or public second brains using the Quartz framework.

### 3. [Smart Link Formatter](/plugins/smart-link-formatter)

Released on 2025-06-25 by [ccmdi](https://github.com/ccmdi)

The **Auto Link Formatter** plugin streamlines how pasted links appear in your notes by automatically converting them into clean, metadata-rich formats. It supports both regular web pages and YouTube links, with customizable templates using variables like title, URL, and for YouTube - channel, views, duration, upload date, and more. This allows you to instantly create tidy references without needing to manually format each one. You can blacklist specific domains to skip formatting, and toggle the automation on or off as needed.

### 4. [Banyan](/plugins/banyan)

Released on 2025-06-24 by [ratiger](https://github.com/ratiger)

The **Banyan** plugin transforms how you browse, filter, and rediscover your notes through a visual card-based interface. It's built for users who jot down quick notes without stressing over perfect titles or folder structures. The card view displays each note with a preview, tags, and optional quick actions like pinning or deleting. Powerful compound filtering lets you search notes by multiple tags, time ranges, or keywords, and you can save these filter conditions for repeated use. A built-in random review tool helps surface forgotten notes, while a heat map offers insights into your writing habits.

### 5. [Simple Banner](/plugins/simple-banner)

Released on 2025-06-24 by [Sandro Ducceschi](https://github.com/eatcodeplay)

The **Simple Banner** plugin lets you visually enhance your notes by adding header banners, icons, and timestamps using just frontmatter properties. It supports internal and external images, video files, and even emojis or custom icons. You can tweak image alignment with horizontal and vertical offsets, repeat images, and autohide frontmatter for a cleaner view. The banner and icon properties are customizable, and settings can be configured separately for desktop, mobile, and tablet.
