Released on 2024-11-12 by [Henrik Seidel](https://github.com/heseber)

The **Perplexity Converter Plugin** for Obsidian addresses the issue of broken reference links in Perplexity outputs.

It also modifies the reference section at the end of the note, making it display correctly without any unnecessary hyperlinks. The plugin only processes selected text, so previously fixed references remain intact. Perfect for anyone who frequently imports content from Perplexity, this tool ensures your citations are usable and well-formatted.
