> There are 26 new plugins, 5 new themes and 94 plugin updates during the week 2025-07-05 to 2025-07-11.

This week, the Obsidian community brings tools that help you visualise your notes as mind maps, sync flashcards directly with Anki, and even add neat interface touches like animated cursors. Along with these, there are updates to popular plugins and some beautifully crafted themes that give your vault a whole new feel. 

## ‚≠ê New Plugins

### 1. [Better Mind Map](/plugins/better-mindmap)

Released on 2025-07-11 by [Utkarsh Raj](https://github.com/linem-davton)

The **Better Mindmap** plugin transforms Markdown outlines into interactive mind maps, offering a dynamic visual representation of your notes. It supports live updates as you edit, allowing seamless navigation between content and mind map view. Users can switch between vertical and horizontal layouts, adjust spacing with rank and node separation sliders, and interact directly with nodes to collapse, expand, or highlight sections. Clicking linked text within nodes opens related notes instantly.

### 2. [Insert Arknights URL Banner](/plugins/insert-arknights-url-banner)

Released on 2025-07-11 by [Rerurate_514](https://github.com/Rerurate514)

The **Insert Arknights URL to banner** plugin allows users to select an image from a predefined Arknights collection and insert its network URL into the `banner` property of the active note's frontmatter. This plugin itself does not provide banner display functionality and requires a separate banner plugin, such as Pixel Banner, to render the images. Users trigger the feature via a command that opens a modal for image selection.

### 3. [Frontmatter Metadata Link Classes](/plugins/frontmatter-link-classes)

Released on 2025-07-11 by [Varvara Zmeeva / zmeeva.io](https://github.com/zmeeeeeva)

The **Metadata Link Classes** plugin automatically applies CSS classes to internal links based on a note's frontmatter metadata. It supports boolean, string, and array values, converting them into targeted classes like `.link-publish-true`, `.link-tags-todo`, or `.link-type-example`. This allows users to style links dynamically using custom CSS, making it easier to visually distinguish notes by their metadata properties such as status, tags, or type.

### 4. [Simple Anki Sync](/plugins/simple-anki-sync)

Released on 2025-07-11 by [Lukas Mayr](https://github.com/lukmay)

The **Simple Anki Sync** plugin provides an efficient way to push Markdown-based flashcards directly into Anki using AnkiConnect. It supports syncing individual files or entire vaults with a single command, handling deck and subdeck structures via tags like `#anki/MyDeck/Subdeck`. Flashcards are written as minimal Markdown tables and can include LaTeX math, images with size adjustments, and line breaks. Quality-of-life features include automatic deck renaming, backlinks to source notes, and tag assignment for easy filtering in Anki. Deleted cards in Obsidian are also removed from Anki during sync, keeping both systems aligned.

Released on 2025-07-11 by [chris-codes1](https://github.com/chris-codes1)

The **Timeline Canvas Creator** plugin simplifies the process of building timeline-structured canvases by automating the placement of cards. Instead of manually arranging each element, you can generate a full timeline by specifying a start date, end date, and interval. This functionality is especially useful for visualising chronological data, planning projects, or outlining historical events without the repetitive task of positioning cards one by one. The plugin integrates directly with the canvas feature, enabling quick setup through a command palette action or the ribbon. It caters to users who need organised visual timelines for workflows, research, or storytelling.

The **Symbol Linking** plugin enhances your note-linking workflow by letting you use custom trigger symbols like @ to quickly create links to notes, folders, or even specific headings within a file. It supports restricting triggers to defined directories or files, making it ideal for organized setups like People/ or Projects.md. The plugin respects aliases set in metadata, ensuring links resolve to nicknames if configured. It integrates with Obsidian's existing Wikilinks setting and offers a compatibility mode for smoother interaction with other suggestion-based plugins.

The **Copy Path** plugin adds convenient context menu actions to quickly copy either the full system path or the vault-relative path of any file or folder in your workspace. It also provides an option to append a trailing slash to folder paths, helping distinguish directories from files during copying. With simple toggle settings, users can enable or disable these actions as per their workflow. This lightweight utility is particularly useful for managing links, organizing references, or sharing precise file locations without manually navigating the filesystem.

It supports both month and week views, letting users insert clean, markdown-based calendar tables with a few commands. Designed for simplicity, the plugin allows you to specify a target month or week and instantly generate structured tables for planning, journaling, or task management. You can also set a default view and quickly insert the current date's calendar.

A custom noun dictionary allows exclusion of proper nouns and domain-specific terms from checks, reducing false positives. The plugin supports large documents by splitting text for stable processing and adapts its UI to Obsidian's light or dark themes. Designed for writers, students, and professionals, it streamlines editing workflows for Korean content in Obsidian.

The **Sidebar Highlights** plugin enhances note-taking by providing a sidebar to view and manage text highlights and comments across your vault. It supports creating highlights with color coding using `==highlight==` syntax and native comments with `%%comment%%`. The sidebar organizes these elements by file, collection, tags, or color, making it easier to navigate and filter key insights. Users can create collections for cross-file highlights, quickly jump to specific highlights, and group them dynamically. It also integrates footnote-based comments for in-line annotations and offers commands for managing collections efficiently.

The **Simple Template Importer** plugin simplifies the process of installing template vaults into your existing workspace by allowing direct import from ZIP files. It automatically places markdown files, CSS snippets, and other template elements in their correct locations within your vault, eliminating the need for manual file management. This is especially useful for users frustrated with the multi-step process of setting up templates, CSS, and configurations manually. The plugin also supports optional import folders and file overwriting to handle conflicts more efficiently, aiming to bring a Notion-style one-click experience to Obsidian.

The **SOC Toolkit** plugin provides cybersecurity professionals and SOC analysts with tools for IP reputation analysis and defanging directly within their notes. It scans IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including defanged variants, and queries VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB APIs for reputation data. Results are cached locally to reduce API calls and displayed in a customizable format. Users can defang IPs in notes via commands or right-click menus, preserving original formatting. The plugin supports both full and last-dot defanging and integrates with the command palette and context menus for quick access.

Released on 2025-07-09 by [Callum Alpass](https://github.com/callumalpass)

The **TaskNotes** plugin transforms task management by treating each task as an individual Markdown note enriched with YAML frontmatter. It supports extensive metadata like due dates, statuses, priorities, contexts, and project links, allowing users to create deeply connected and highly customizable workflows. With multiple views including calendar, kanban boards, filtered lists, and daily agendas, it fits both simple to-do tracking and complex project planning. Time tracking features like start/stop timers, session history, and an integrated pomodoro timer help monitor productivity. Tasks can also recur with per-instance tracking, and the plugin supports ICS feed subscriptions for syncing with external calendars. The ability to extend frontmatter for custom fields enhances compatibility with other Obsidian tools like Bases.

Released on 2025-07-09 by [Mousebomb](https://github.com/mousebomb)

The **Diary ICS** plugin synchronizes your Obsidian diary entries with system calendar applications like macOS Calendar or Windows Calendar by generating an ICS subscription link.

Inspired by tools like Roam and Logseq, it enhances Obsidian's native Backlinks in Document feature by offering a more comprehensive and configurable view. This is particularly useful for users who capture quick notes in daily streams without immediately sorting them into folder hierarchies. Aliases can be applied to narrow down the displayed backlinks, making it easier to locate related content during review.

Each row represents a project, while columns map to dates, allowing users to assign and track tasks visually. Tasks can be marked as Haven't Started, In Progress, or Completed, making it easier to monitor progress at a glance. This layout is suitable for project planning, workload management, and keeping multiple initiatives on track without clutter.

It provides custom LaTeX commands to embed RTL text within mathematical formulas and allows nesting of left-to-right (LTR) text or math expressions inside RTL contexts. Users can even customise command names for flexibility. However, it currently lacks support for languages with combining letters such as Arabic, pending improvements in MathJax 4.0.

### 26. [Eccirian Encrypt](/plugins/eccirian)

Released on 2025-07-08 by [Entropiex](https://github.com/Enthalpiex)

The **Eccirian Encrypt** plugin adds file-level encryption and decryption to your vault, using AES-256-GCM and ECC-P-256 password-based encryption. It introduces a dedicated `.eccirian` file extension and replaces the editor view of locked files with a read-only message until the correct password is entered. Users can quickly toggle encryption via the command palette or UI controls, making it practical for managing sensitive notes without leaving the app. The plugin does not store passwords, so forgotten credentials mean permanent data loss.
