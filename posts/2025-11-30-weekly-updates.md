## New Feature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I am glad to announce the feature that I've been working on for some time: [ObsidianStats](https://www.obsidianstats.com) now supports ratings and reviews for [plugins](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins) and [themes](https://www.obsidianstats.com/themes). You can log in with Google today, and we'll soon add email/password and more OAuth options to make sign-in easier for everyone. Your ratings and reviews will appear directly on each plugin and theme page, giving creators and users clearer insights. As the platform grows and we collect enough feedback, we'll also introduce sorting based on ratings and reviews to help you discover the best tools faster.

The last week of November brought a steady rush of updates, and it feels like the perfect buildup as we move toward the year-end celebrations. A new plugin, Nutstore Sync, steps in with a clean and efficient way to sync notes using WebDAV. Alongside that, seventy eight plugins received updates, keeping the workflow smoother for everyone. We also got six new themes that add fresh colour and personality to our vaults.

## ⭐ New Plugins

### 1. [Nutstore Sync](/plugins/nutstore-sync)

Released on 2025-11-28 by [nutstore-dev](https://github.com/nutstore)

The **Nutstore Sync** plugin provides a two-way bridge between your notes and Nutstore using the WebDAV protocol. It handles incremental updates so only modified files move across, which keeps large vaults responsive. Sync behaviour can be tuned through loose mode, file-size limits, and conflict resolution rules that compare changes at character level or fall back to timestamps. A built in explorer lets you navigate and manage remote files, while real-time status indicators and detailed logs help you understand what's happening during each sync cycle. The plugin also supports single sign on to simplify authentication.
