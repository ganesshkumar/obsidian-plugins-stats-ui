> There are 3 new plugins and 59 plugin updates during the week 2025-12-14 to 2025-12-20.

Merry christmas! The holiday mood is in full swing. During the last week 3 new plugins were released along with 59 plugin updates, quietly improving day-to-day workflows. No big noise, just steady progress landing right before the break.

I have updated [Obsidian Wrapped 2025](https://www.obsidianstats.com/posts/2025-12-04-wrapped-2025) with the latest metrics.

David V. Kimball released [Sample Plugin Plus](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-sample-plugin-plus) and [Sample Theme Plus](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-sample-theme-plus) - powerful templates for plugin and theme development in AI assisted environment.
