## ⭐ New Plugins

### 1. [Daily Notes Tweaks](/plugins/daily-notes-tweaks)

Released on 2025-11-13 by [René Coignard](https://github.com/coignard)

The **Daily Notes Tweaks** plugin streamlines how you revisit and browse through dated entries by adding a simple but effective set of enhancements. Its main command opens a random daily note from your archive, which makes it easier to stumble upon forgotten thoughts or track long-term patterns without manually scrolling through folders. When you jump into an older entry, the plugin can automatically switch it to reading mode, reducing the chance of accidental edits and giving you a cleaner view of past writing. Today's note stays in editing mode so your routine journaling remains uninterrupted.

### 2. [Typographer](/plugins/typographer)

Released on 2025-11-13 by [René Coignard](https://github.com/coignard)

The **Typographer** plugin refines the writing workflow by applying clean, consistent typography as you type. It replaces straight quotes with well-formed curly variants and lets you choose exactly which characters should act as opening and closing marks. Writers who use symbols, mathematical operators, or multilingual punctuation can set up custom replacement rules that trigger instantly while typing. The plugin also supports auto-pairing for characters like guillemets or brackets, dropping the closing symbol automatically and positioning the cursor neatly in between. All rules are fully editable from the settings panel, giving you space to build your own style without affecting code blocks or metadata zones.

### 3. [Scroller](/plugins/scroller)

Released on 2025-11-13 by [René Coignard](https://github.com/coignard)

The **Scroller** plugin enhances the writing experience by reshaping how the editor reacts to movement, focus, and navigation. It introduces a typewriter mode that keeps the active line anchored at a steady height, creating a stable rhythm while typing. A dedicated focus mode dims surrounding text at various scopes, helping you stay locked in on the ideas you are shaping. The plugin also adds instant scrolling commands for jumping to the top or bottom of long notes, and it can autoscroll daily notes so you land exactly where new writing should begin.

### 4. [Timestamper](/plugins/timestamper)

Released on 2025-11-13 by [René Coignard](https://github.com/coignard)

The **Timestamper** plugin adds a quick, reliable way to drop the current time into your notes, making it handy for people who log activities or maintain daily journals. It focuses on a single command that inserts a timestamp in a format you control, and the behaviour adapts to different writing styles. If you trigger it from another file, it can automatically open today's daily note before writing the entry. You can choose whether the timestamp appears at the end of the document or in the first empty spot after your cursor, and optional auto-scrolling keeps your view aligned with new entries.
