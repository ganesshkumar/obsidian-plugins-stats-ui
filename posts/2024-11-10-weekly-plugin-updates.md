### 2. [Peekaboo](/plugins/peekaboo)

Released on 2024-11-08 by [Wang Guoshi](https://github.com/Lio5n)

**Peekaboo** is a privacy-focused Obsidian plugin that allows users to easily hide specific files and folders within their vault, offering greater control over content visibility. With options to password-protect your settings and use patterns to hide multiple files at once, Peekaboo makes it simple to manage sensitive notes. It includes a ribbon icon and command palette integration, so toggling visibility is quick and efficient. For those looking to keep certain files accessible, Peekaboo lets users configure exceptions to keep select files visible, even within hidden folders. Keep in mind, though, that Peekaboo hides files visually but doesn’t encrypt them, so combining it with Obsidian's "Excluded Files" feature is recommended for more comprehensive privacy.

The plugin features an “Open View” command that brings up a control panel where you can add or remove MOC links for selected notes, filter by MOC-only notes, and even track down “missing notes” that should be part of an MOC but aren’t yet linked. Ideal for desktop users looking to keep their Obsidian workspace tidy, MOC Link Helper makes managing complex note networks simple.

With an easy-to-use interface, users can estimate storage costs, verify wallet balances, and get a shareable link for each upload.

This formatting style is especially useful for languages like Japanese, where proper indentation can be critical for readability and aesthetics. By installing this plugin, users can ensure that their notes maintain the intended structure, including correct indentation in reading mode.
